# Skills assessment test:
As part of your application for our training program, you worked on a project that had to introduce safety tools for engineers



It sounds like you've accomplished quite a bit with your project! Training a dataset with over 3000 images of various 
situation is a significant undertaking, and achieving excellent accuracy in detection after 50 epochs is impressive.

Using the YOLOv8n model was a wise choice, considering its speed, accuracy, and suitability for detection tasks. 
YOLO (You Only Look Once) models are known for their ability to efficiently detect objects in images by dividing 
them into a grid and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell.

The underlying CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architecture of YOLOv8n is well-suited for image processing tasks,
as it can automatically learn features from the input images and make predictions based on those features.

By accurately predicting the classes of objects in the images, your model can be applied to various applications,
including object detection in real-time video streams, surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, and more.
